        **Background**
        The research landscape that encompass study designs, execution processes, and resulting outputs can evolve 
        in numerous ways, reflecting shifts in priorities, innovations, and the impact of external influences on its 
        enterprises. Much research waste has been increasingly reported. Poorly conducted clinical and biomedical 
        researches are detrimental to the health of the people and healthcare performance with misleading clinical 
        evidence. Efforts to improve research performance will need good data on the profiles and performance of past 
        research. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics and examine the quality of 
        clinical and biomedical research in Malaysia and Indonesia (other country could participate in the same manner).

        **Methods**
        A search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO to identify for published clinical 
        and biomedical research from 1962 to 2019 from Malaysia. Additional search will also be 
        conducted in MyMedR. Studies that were identified from the databases will be independently 
        screened by a team of reviewers, relevant information will be extracted and the quality of articles will be 
        assessed. In Phase 1, the characteristics of the research including the profiles of the researchers and the 
        journals in which they are published will be reported descriptively. In Phase 2, a research quality screening 
        tool will be validated to assess the research quality based on three domains of relevance, the credibility of 
        the methods and usefulness of the results. Associations between the research characteristics and quality will 
        be analysed. The independent effect of each of the determinant will be quantified in multivariable regression 
        analysis. Longitudinal trends of the research characteristics, health conditions studied and settings, among 
        others will be explored.

        **Results**
        Of 4513 articles, 1078 were included in this qualitative synthesis (https://rb.gy/zjwr8d). Dataset that is made
        available here was the results from the Malaysian primary care setting, the search strategy is available here (https://rb.gy/jd91ey).
        Malaysian colleagues and those whose studies and papers have been included or not included in the dataset are welcomed to check out
        the dataset, to clean the entries and to add to it if the papers are deem eligible based on criteria and search strategy.
        Other research-related outputs at primary care setting will be added in near future once this plarform works well.
        Phase 2 of the project may be conducted with artificial intelligence. Some preliminary results have been generated with
        ChatGPT Deep Research model. They are to be validated and verified.

        **Discussion**
        Results of this study will serve as the 'baseline' data for future evaluation and within the country and between 
        countries comparison. This review may also provide informative results to a diverse range of stakeholders 
        including researchers, academics, funding agencies, academic institutions, policymakers, industry partners, 
        the public, publishers, research administrators, educators, students, and technology developers by offering 
        insights into the evolution of research conduct and performance from the past to the present. The longitudinal 
        and prospective trends of the research characteristics and quality could provide suggestions on improvement 
        initiatives. Additionally, information on health conditions, research settings, and whether they are over- or 
        under-studied may help future prioritization of research initiatives and resources.
